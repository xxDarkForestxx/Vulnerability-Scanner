# Vulnerability-Scanner
Deploying a Nessus Vulnerability Scanner for eliminate security vulnerabilities. 
This was done on an old computer to allow me to show and demonstate my abilities to scan and remediate issues.
This free trial only had 15 Scans so unforunately I could only show the first round of scans but one should always rescan to confirm the issue is resolved.
In the order you will find the inniate scans and it will will lable it by severity as well as give detailed guides on how to remedy the security issues.
In the last image I was able to go through the register editor and change the value to enable security signature to resolve one of my security issues.
