# Vulnerability-Scanner
Deployed a Nessus Vulnerability Scanner to eliminate security vulnerabilities on a deprecated computer. 
This was done to allow me to demonstate my abilities to scan and remediate issues.
This free trial only had 15 Scans and I used them to scan the rest of the network but you should always rescan your systems after they have been remediated to ensure security.
In the images you will find CVSS scores of all the vulnerabilities from zero to 10, with information on how to resolve the issues by clicking on the tabs.
In the last image I was able to go through the register editor and change the value to enable security signature to resolve one of my CVSS scores of 5.3
My last issue was solved by no longer using the Nessus vulnerability scanner because it was a self sighning certificate.
